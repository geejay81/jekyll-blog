I've created this site as a diary about some of the things I am working on in the world of web development. I have been developing websites since 2000, and over that time I have used all sorts of technologies and learnt much - although I've forgotten so much of it now.

I'm hoping by keeping this diary, it'll serve as a reminder of solutions I've found to recurring issues I have. 

I was really interested to have a look at Jekyll so I've decided to build this site using that in the hope that I'll pick up quite a lot of knowledge about it.
